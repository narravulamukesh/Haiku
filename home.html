        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4 reddit-sans">What is Haiku OS?</h2>
        <p class="mb-8 ">Haiku is an open-source operating system under constant development. Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open-source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, toolkit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open-source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a unique level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.</p>
